# _La Pinya_ 05: End-of-block synthesis

Building on our exploration of participant observation, thick description, and positionality in ethnographic research, this concluding session/exercise challenges you to apply these concepts to technological contexts. We'll draw on your understanding of core ethnographic methods while pushing you to consider how these approaches might need to adapt when studying online communities and digital practices.

## Concluding exercise

Riffing on [your own notes](documentation\computational_thinking\02a_signs_and_portents.md) on "The Zen of Python" PEP, and [Fedorova et al.'s article](https://doi.org/10.1177/01622439241245746) on the organisational and disciplinary (?) effects of "ugly code" at Yandex, how might we begin to rough out plans for a 3-6 month ethnographic pilot project on aesthetics & valuation among (a) Python programmers, (b) permacomputing as a community of practice, or (c) [barefoot developers](https://justinpickard.net/log/2024/06/17/barefoot-and-malleable/)[^1]?

Think about:

- some appropriately-scoped research questions
- how you might go about gaining access to these groups
- how you would approach and bound the field site, both conceptually and in more practical terms?
- possible applications of classic "participant observation" (and/or other combinations of participation & observation)
- specific challenges presented by these contexts
- what other research methods or techniques you might need to deploy alongside more conventional or traditional ethnographic observations (as triangulation?)
- how your own positionality and reflexivity might play out (as asset/liability/resource) in each of these contexts?
- what "thick description" might look like in each of these settings, and how it might differ from the traditional ethnographic ideal?

What would be distinctive about focusing on aesthetics/valuation as opposed to other possible thematics? Where and how would our plans for researching these three different groups/communities/roles diverge? How would this differ from looking at, e.g., the Tarragona castelliers's use of the colla app?
