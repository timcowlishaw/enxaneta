# _La Pinya_ 05: End-of-block synthesis

Building on our exploration of participant observation, thick description, and positionality in ethnographic research, this concluding session/exercise challenges you to apply these concepts to technological contexts. We'll draw on your understanding of core ethnographic methods while pushing you to consider how these approaches might need to adapt when studying online communities and digital practices.

## Concluding exercise

Riffing on [your own notes](documentation\computational_thinking\02a_signs_and_portents.md) on "The Zen of Python" PEP, and [Fedorova et al.'s article](https://doi.org/10.1177/01622439241245746) on the organisational and disciplinary (?) effects of "ugly code" at Yandex, I want us to start roughing out plans for a small, 2-3 month ethnographic pilot project.

1. **Research questions:** Develop 2-3 research questions for each of the following groups, focusing on aesthetics and valuation:
(a) Python programmers
(b) The permacomputing community
(c) [Barefoot developers](https://justinpickard.net/log/2024/06/17/barefoot-and-malleable/)[^1]

Consider how these questions might differ across the three contexts, despite addressing similar thematics.

2. **Field site and access:** For each group, consider:
- What physical and digital spaces constitute the "field"?
- How might you gain access to these communities?
- What ethical (and other) considerations should you keep in mind when approaching these groups?

Ethnography often involves multi-sited fieldwork. How might you navigate different combinations of online and offline spaces?

3. **Methods and techniques:** Beyond participant observation, what other methods might be particularly suited to studying each group? Be creative, and reflect on how your proposed methods might need to be adapted for each context.[^2]

4. **Reflexivity and positionality:** How are you oriented in relation to each group? How might this influence your approach and angle of entry? Consider, for example:
- What assumptions might you bring to the research based on your previous experiences?
- How might your technical skills be both an asset and a potential source of bias?
- Are there any ethical dilemmas that could arise from your insider/outsider status?

5. **Comparative analysis:** Create a table or matrix comparing your approaches across the three groups. Consider the most salient axes of comparison, based on your interests and the groups in quesiton. These might include:
- Similarities and differences in research questions
- Variations in field site boundaries and access strategies
- Methodological adaptations for each context
- Potential challenges unique to each group

6. **Speculative fieldnotes:** Draft a brief (250-500 word) ethnographic vignette imagining a scene from fieldwork with one of these groups. Aim to synthesise or address some of the points emerging from earlier stages in this exercise. Think about how you might capture the sensory and experiential aspects of these groups' practices.

[^1]: Imagined here less as a community than, say, an emerging, inchoate subject position (???); not-yet-actually-existing, more a figure/figuration of a particular knot of trends and developments?
[^2]: You might consider, for example, digital trace ethnography for analysing online interactions, virtual interviews or focus groups,  "interface ethnography", [chaines operatoires](https://justinpickard.net/compost/cha%C3%AEne-op%C3%A9ratoires/), collaborative mapping exercises, close readings of particular media artifacts, analysis of code repositories or documentation practices. Bring me your weirdest methods, and we can talk them through.
