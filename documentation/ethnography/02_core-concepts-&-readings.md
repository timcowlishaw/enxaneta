# _La Pinya_ 02: Core Concepts and Readings

Okay, so running alongside any observation and fieldnote exercises, we're looking to get some key ideas under our belts (_faixes_?) before moving on to look more closely at a specific case (likely to be the Castell Colla App).

Having had a big old ramble through the framing and big-picture sequencing of the ethnographic track of this first block last time we spoke, the main topics/concepts I want to get across in the coming weeks are:

1. **Participant observation**
2. **Thick description**
3. **Fieldnotes**
4. **Communities of practice**
5. Ethnography as **collaborative, ethical inquiry** (as a prelude to a deeper discussion of this later in this first block)

We've both now read anthropologist of sport Mariann Vaczi's  2023 ethnographic monograph _[Catalonia's Human Towers](https://iupress.org/9780253067166/catalonias-human-towers/)_, and Benjamin Bowes' article '[‘What do you mean you haven't got tools?’](https://doi.org/10.3167/ajec.2023.320206)', on liveaboard canal boaters as a community of practice.
  

## Participant observation and "being there"

We've talked a little bit about participant observation already, but I want to zoom in more on the idea of "being there" and the importance of "shoe-leather" immersion in the field.

Discuss how participant observation can be used to gain a deeper understanding of cultural practices, using examples from Vaczi's book, such as the chapter on touch and the body. What's interesting about Vaczi's work is her positioning in the field of sport ethnography, which can highlight the key tensions in (near-impossibility of?) trying to participate and observe _at the same time_. There's some other material I can refer to here, from studies of surfing, boxing, and mixed martial arts.

It will also be worth talking, albeit briefly, about the options when participation isn't possible (interface ethnography, "studying up", different forms of 'patchwork ethnography' and 'polymorphous engagement'), which is something we can definitely go deeper on and/or return to in future.

Refer to the BBC podcast "Participating and Observing" (Ep. 4 of _From Savage to Self_, 2016) as a supplementary resource.

## Thick description and fieldnotes

Introducing the concept of thick description as a criteria of appraisal. We'll talk a bit about the significance of thick description as a point of differentiation for ethnography, where it fits in the process of ethnographic research, and the importance of fieldnotes in producing such 'thick' and detailed accounts.

We'll look at some examples from the Benjamin Bowes article to illustrate how thick description can be used to capture the nuances of social practices, perhaps by exploring the idea of "enskilment" and how it relates to the concept of taskscapes  referenced by Bowes (Ingold).

We'll discuss different strategies and approaches for taking fieldnotes, the role they play in capturing qualitative data, and how they can be used to inform analysis and writing. For this, I'll pull on some bits from the _Naked Fieldnotes_ book, which too much to ask you to wade through, but has some great weird details.

In all of this, it'd be good to be able to draw on your own experiences of observation and note-taking, through the exercises I've thrown at you, with an eye to talking through any challenges or questions you have.

## Communities of practice

Able to draw on some existing teaching resources on different constructions of community, I also think it could be interesting to try and apply these core ethnographic concepts to the three groups you've identified as  relevant _communities of practice_ in your 2024-25 PhD research plan:

1. The _permacomputing_ community[^1]
2. Artists and designers working on digital materiality
3. Makers of _Tiny Weird Software_ (after Lawhead, 2021)

Before we move on to look at the Castellers, I want to discuss how ethnography could be used to study these communities, and how participant observation can help identify patterns and practices. Some of this might include you reflecting on your own experiences with these communities, and how you see yourself situated within them.

We can refer to the readings by Maja Hojer Bruun and Cathrine Hasse (2022) and Nicolas Nova and Anaïs Bloch (2023) as supplementary resources. There's also the OG, Etienne Wenger, in his 1998 book _Communities of Practice_.

### Mapping core concepts and developing a shared glossary

As a kind of culmination of this first sub-block, we'll need to review the core concepts discussed in previous sessions (participant observation, thick description, fieldnotes, communities of practice, etc.).

I want to then discuss how these concepts can be used to inform the research design and methodology for your pilot project with the Colla app, with an eye to starting to poke at how the study of software and technologies can challenge and/or extend typical ethnographic methods.

I'm also thinking we start to develop a shared glossary of key terms, ensuring that we both have a common understanding of the concepts (across the ethnography and Python components of all this). Is there somewhere persistent this could live?  


### Readings (and listenings)

If you have time in the next week or so, these are the most important things to work through: 
  
- [Participating and Observing](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b06zdkb7), Ep. 4 of _From Savage to Self_ (2016) (14min)
- Maja Hojer Bruun, and Cathrine Hasse, ‘Communities, Collectives, and Categories’ (2022), in _The Palgrave Handbook of the Anthropology of Technology_, Singapore: Springer Nature Singapore.[^2]
- Nicolas Nova and Anaïs Bloch, '[“My Store is a Laboratory”: Knowledge Produced by Smartphone Repairers](https://doi.org/10.17351/ests2023.1337)' (2023)
