# _La Pinya_ 04: Positionality & Reflexivity in Practice

Positionality and reflexivity are crucial concepts in ethnographic research, requiring careful consideration and ongoing practice (all the more so if we're operating outside of academic contexts). As you continue to practice ethnographic field observation and consider how this mode of inquiry might be usefully turned to studying software, apps, and digital practices, it is important to reflect on how your background, experiences, and perspectives shape your own research.

Notions of positionality and reflexivity emerged during the 'reflexive' or 'postmodern turn' in anthropology in the 1970s, as scholars started to question the authority and objectivity of ethnographic representations. Feminist and postcolonial critiques highlighted the power dynamics inherent in the research relationship, and the need for researchers to acknowledge their assumptions and biases. This marked a departure from earlier research traditions that assumed a clear separation between the researcher and the researched, while seeking to produce objective, authoritative accounts of cultural others.

The extent to which researchers can fully account for their positionality and achieve reflexivity remains a subject of debate. Some argue complete reflexivity is impossible, as researchers can never fully escape their own subjectivities (Rose, 1997). Others contend that an overemphasis on reflexivity can lead to naval-gazing, detracting from the substantive focus of the research (Patai, 1994).[^1] Nevertheless, reflexive practice and explicitly addressing one's positionality have become key parts of ethnographic research.

## Positionality: Situating the researcher

> ‘What you hear, and even the access you are granted, will depend on how other people see you, as well as the things you are more likely to notice because of who you are.’ (Timmermans and Tavory, 2022: 63)

Positionality refers to the researcher's social, cultural, and political position in relation to the research context and participants. It encompasses the different (overlapping, plural) identities, experiences, and worldviews that researchers bring to their work. In ethnographic research, positionality is particularly salient, as researchers engage in prolonged, often intimate engagements with their research subjects.

From what I know, your positionality is shaped by your status as an Englishman living in Catalonia, and your background in art, computer science, and creative technology. Your interests and work history sensitize you to the socio-technical entanglements of digital technologies and their embedding in broader cultural and political contexts.

Your positionality will also be influenced by your personal experiences, values, and beliefs regarding community practices, cultural traditions, and the role of technology in shaping social dynamics. Reflecting on these aspects can help you identify biases, assumptions, enthusiasms, or blind spots that may affect your research.

Consider what assumptions or expectations you might bring to studying digital practices based on your prior experiences with and knowledge about technology. How might these preconceptions shape what you focus on or overlook.

### 🚣 "Rivers of Life" exercise

As an exercise in starting to grapple with your positionality, and something for us to call back to later, I want you take a half-hour (or longer?) to sketch the stories of your life and career using the metaphor of a river.

- Bends, twists, turns: turning points
- Width or narrowness: about breadth of concentration / focusing in
- Tributaries flowing into your river: formative influences, training, key ideas or relationships?
- Rapids, slow-flowing eddies, whirpools, rough waters … waterfalls?

And think about your positionality in relation to "your" communities. Those you’ve interacted with, or been a member of.

- Local communities, imagined communities, communities of practice, associations
- Those you identified in your research plan? (art about technological materialities, permaculture, Tiny Weird Software)

What experiences or relationships sparked your interest in waste and digital technologies? Mark these as tributaries on your river.

Have you faced any "rough waters" related to working across disciplinary boundaries or studying socio-technical phenomena? Depict these challenges on your river.

What's the terrain like around your river - is it rocky, forested, urban? How does the surrounding environment shape the river's path?

Are there dams, bridges, or other human-made structures along your river? What do they represent?


## Reflexivity: Navigating research

Reflexivity is the ongoing process of critically examining and acknowledging how your positionality shapes the research process, from formulating questions to interpreting and representing your findings. Reflexivity involves continuously interrogating your assumptions, decisions, and interactions with research participants and data. In short, ethnographic reflexivity can be seen as the 'process of making sense of the various selves that researchers embody while conducting research.' (Mwangi, 2019: 17) We, specifically, will be seeking to move beyond treatments of bias/subjectivity/positionality as ‘ghosts we are trained to ritualistically bury at the start of our research’ (McCorkel and Myers, 2003: 200). Not just about intersectional identities (gender, age, race, class, language).

What's perhaps distinctive about ethnography is the extent to which you are your observation tool. So, thinking about the different lenses, interests, and experiences you bring to a situation, your vulnerabilities, your partnerships with those you’re researching, how much power you have (to shape your research), and of what kind.

Reflecting on your initial observational exercises, and looking ahead to what you might be going on to do next, it'll be useful to reflect on:

- Methodological reflexivity: Evaluating the suitability of research methods and analytical approaches for studying digital practices.
- Interpersonal reflexivity: Reflecting on dynamics and power relations between researcher and participants.
- Analytical reflexivity: Examining how your positionality and theoretical lenses shape your interpretations and representations.
- Ethical reflexivity: Considering the ethical implications of your research decisions, particularly concerning issues of power, privacy, consent, and potential harms.

Rather than seeking definitive answers or universal truths, your research can contribute to ongoing conversations and debates surrounding the co-construction of technology and society. This might require reflecting on your actions and identity, and/or writing and talking openly about the difficulties of research, struggles, mess and
uncertainty (as handholds for the reader, to see how you got to your results). 

There are few clear answers about how much to show of the otherwise obscured ‘assumptions, motivations, narratives, and relations’ which comprise the ‘backstage’ of qualitative research. (McCorkel and Myers, 2003: 200)
But by engaging in reflexive practices, you can situate your findings in relation to broader discourses, while acknowledging the partiality and situatedness of your knowledge claims.


## 🗪 Some specific prompts and questions

- Reflect on your motivations for wanting to studying the Castell Colla community and their use of the app. Beyond intellectual curiosity, are there any personal experiences or values driving your interest in this topic? How might these shape what you focus on or overlook in your observations and analysis?
- How does your status as a non-native resident of Catalonia affect your access to and rapport with the Castell Colla community? In what ways might you be perceived as an outsider, and how can you navigate those dynamics sensitively? Conversely, are there any aspects of your identity or experience that help you build trust/credibility with participants?[^2] How can you (ethically) leverage those points of connection?
- As an English researcher, how might your cultural background influence your perceptions of Catalan traditions like the human towers? Are there aspects that feel especially foreign, intriguing, or in need of explanation from your outsider perspective? Conversely, are there ways your extended time in Catalonia provides useful context for understanding the significance of these practices?
- Your interdisciplinary identity spans fields with very different epistemological assumptions, from the arts to computer science. How do you navigate these in your research? Are there tensions you have to reconcile or make explicit?
- How does your role as a practice-based researcher using research-through-design methods impact your relationship with research participants and the knowledge production process? How do your skills and sensibilities as a maker shape the types of research products you develop? How do you see your role in relation to your participants - as an interpreter, collaborator, provocateur? What power dynamics or ethical considerations might arise?
- As we discussed last time, studying digital technologies ethnographically means your research field is not a fixed location. How do you conceive of your "field site(s)" in this project (and others), and how does your identity/positionality shift across contexts? What different types of insider/outsider statuses might you need to negotiate?
- What personal experiences, values, or beliefs do you hold regarding technology, consumption, and waste that might shape your research focuses and analysis? Will your participants share or contest these framings?
- Reflexivity is an ongoing process, not a one-time exercise. How will you build in opportunities for reflection throughout your research to surface evolving assumptions, blind spots, and ethical dilemmas? Consider keeping a reflexive journal to document key decision points.[^3]
- Positionality statements make researcher subjectivity visible. How much of your identity and backstory feels relevant to disclose to establish credibility and rapport with participants? With research audiences? What are the trade-offs of more versus less personal disclosure in different contexts?[^4]
