# _La Pinya_ 01: Ethnographic Observation

This exercise is an opportunity to practice observation while taking fieldnotes. Although the primary goal is to get a handle on systematic documentation, we're also interested in starting to cultivate an _ethnographic stance/disposition/imagination_, so be open to casual interactions and pay attention to your own embodied experiences (hunches, disconcertment, surprise, etc.) as sources of insight.
  
Embrace the discomfort of trying a new method while working through these exercises, and focus on experimenting and flexing your observation and note-taking muscles. It's important to stress that the goal is not to produce perfect fieldnotes or profound insights, but to establish a baseline and identify areas for growth.

## Observation exercises

1. Select 2-3 public, well-populated spaces that provide opportunities for observing social interaction and cultural practices (e.g., parks, cafes, markets, public transit). Aim for a diversity of settings and situations. Consider choosing sites that are relevant to your wider interests, such as:
	- Spaces where people interact with technology or mobile devices
	- Spaces designed to facilitate or constrain particular activities and types of interaction
	- Spaces where cultural identities and group boundaries are performed and negotiated
2. Conduct 30-60 minute observation sessions in each location. Visit at different times of day, if possible, to capture temporal variations.
3. During each session, focus on observing, using a small notebook to record notes on:
	- The physical space and material context
	- People's activities, interactions, and movements
	- Snippets of dialogue or conversation
	- Sensory details (sights, sounds, smells, etc.)
	- Your own position, role, and subjective responses as an observer
4. Aim to be an unobtrusive observer, but be open to casual interactions and short conversations if they arise. Be mindful of ethical considerations and power dynamics. If approached, be prepared to explain your purpose, and withdraw if your presence is unwelcome.
5. Immediately after each observation session, take time to review your jottings and expand them into more detailed fieldnotes while your experiences are still fresh. Aim for a combination of descriptive and interpretive content, with an emphasis on concrete details.

## Fieldnote template

- Date, time, location
- Detailed description of the setting, people, activities, and interactions observed
- Key moments, interactions, or quotes that stood out
- Reflexive comments on your own role, reactions, and interpretations
- Tentative insights, questions, or themes to explore further
- Methodological notes on the process of observing and writing, any challenges faced, etc.

Consider experimenting with different formats (e.g., narrative, bulleted lists, sketches) to find what works best for you (and we can talk more about these options), but ensure that each entry is clearly dated and contextualised.

## Reflective exercise

After completing the observation sessions, read through your full set of fieldnotes and write a short reflective memo on:

- What you noticed about your own observational approach and note-taking practices
- Any challenges or uncertainties you encountered in the process
- How your notes did or didn't capture the "feel" and meaning of the scenes you observed
- What kind of contextual knowledge might be needed to enrich your account
- Thoughts on how the exercise might inform your approach to studying the Castell Colla app
- Questions or topics you would be interested in exploring further, through discussion or future fieldwork

In looking at what you've produced, we'll aim to debrief, compare insights, and consider the implications of your experiences for our next steps.
