# _La Pinya_ 02: Core Ethnographic Concepts

Okay, so running alongside any observation and fieldnote exercises, we're looking to get some key ideas under our belts (_faixes_?) before moving on to look more closely at a specific case (likely to be the Castell Colla App).

<< [Session 1](01_ethnographic-observation.md) | [Session 3](03_core-ethnographic-concepts-2.md) >>

## Overview

Having had a big old ramble through the framing and big-picture sequencing of the ethnographic track of this first block last time we spoke, the main topics/concepts I want to get across in the coming weeks are:

1. **Participant observation**
2. **Thick description**
3. **Fieldnotes**
4. **Communities of practice**
5. Ethnography as **collaborative, ethical inquiry** (as a prelude to a deeper discussion of this later in this first block)

We've both now read anthropologist of sport Mariann Vaczi's 2023 ethnographic monograph _[Catalonia's Human Towers](https://iupress.org/9780253067166/catalonias-human-towers/)_, and Benjamin Bowes' article '[‘What do you mean you haven't got tools?’](https://doi.org/10.3167/ajec.2023.320206)', on liveaboard canal boaters as a community of practice.


## Participant observation and "being there"

We've talked a little bit about participant observation already, but I want to zoom in more on the idea of "being there" and the importance of "shoe-leather" immersion in the field.

Discuss how participant observation can be used to gain a deeper understanding of cultural practices, using examples from Vaczi's book, such as the chapter on touch and the body. What's interesting about Vaczi's work is her positioning in the field of sport ethnography, which can highlight the key tensions in (near-impossibility of?) trying to participate and observe _at the same time_. There's some other material I can refer to here, from studies of surfing, boxing, and mixed martial arts.

It is also be worth talking, albeit briefly, about the options when participation isn't possible (interface ethnography, "studying up", different forms of 'patchwork ethnography' and 'polymorphous engagement'), which is something we can definitely go deeper on and/or return to in future.

Refer to the BBC podcast "Participating and Observing" (Ep. 4 of _From Savage to Self_, 2016) as a supplementary resource.

## Observation exercise: Salou

Post-session update: We talked through your experiences doing some mobile observations in Salou, a tourist hub 10 minutes away from Taragona by train. Having had a vague hunch/proto-theory about "foreignness" that you'd hoped to poke at, you shared your frustrations about the lack of an obvious epicentre or focus point where you could perch and hang out, and ended up doing something closer to _flânerie_, wandering and drifting through this liminal space.

You noted that you'd caught yourself trying to prematurely shoehorn your observations into a narrative, perhaps struggling a little with the compression/decompression of observations via fieldnotes absent any strong or pre-existing through-story, or 'hierarchy of salience' (Wolfinger 2002):

> 'Ethnographers frequently choose to record a particular observation because it stands out. Observations often stand out because they are deviant, either when compared to others or with respect to a researcher’s existing knowledge and beliefs. Either way, background knowledge influences which cases are chosen for annotation.' (Wolfinger 2002: 90)


## Field sites

Post-session update: We also talked a bit about the 'neatly-bounded' ethnographic fieldsite in an age of digital, mobile, and translocal phenomena. I referenced Matei Candea's concept of the traditional fieldsite as an 'arbitrary location', Paolo Heywood's subsequent work on Bologna as an 'equivocal location' from which to investigate difference in leftist politics, and Jenna Burrell's work on the fieldsite as a network actively constructed by the researcher, incorporating physical, virtual, and imagined spaces (with reference to research on early internet use in Ghana).


## Communities of practice

Able to draw on some existing teaching resources on different constructions of community, I also think it could be interesting to try and apply these core ethnographic concepts to the three groups you've identified as  relevant _communities of practice_ in your 2024-25 PhD research plan:

1. The _permacomputing_ community[^1]
2. Artists and designers working on digital materiality
3. Makers of _Tiny Weird Software_ (after Lawhead, 2021)

Before we move on to look at the Castellers, I want to discuss how ethnography could be used to study these communities, and how participant observation can help identify patterns and practices. Some of this might include you reflecting on your own experiences with these communities, and how you see yourself situated within them.

We can refer to the readings by Maja Hojer Bruun and Cathrine Hasse (2022) and Nicolas Nova and Anaïs Bloch (2023) as supplementary resources. There's also the OG, Etienne Wenger, in his 1998 book _Communities of Practice_.
