# _La Pinya_ 05: Fieldnotes

<< [Session 4](04_positionality-and-reflexivity.md) | Session 6 >>

## Fieldnotes

We'll discuss different strategies and approaches for taking fieldnotes, the role they play in capturing qualitative data, and how they can be used to inform analysis and writing. For this, I'll pull on my own fieldnotes from The World Transformed, some bits from the _Naked Fieldnotes_ book, which is too much to ask you to wade through but has some great weird details.

- Salience hierarchy vs. comprehensive note-taking (cf. Wolfinger 2002).

- Space, actor, activity, object, act, event, time, goal, feeling (Spradley, 1980)

In all of this, we'll draw on your own experiences of observation and note-taking, through the exercises I've thrown at you, while addressing any challenges or questions you may have that emerged from this.

[^2]: Revealing summary of a survey of 70 anthropologists' attitudes to fieldnotes; gets a bit repetitive beyond page 15, so just skim it.
[^3]: As an abductive analysis guy, cannot recommend this book more highly. Look at sections titled: ‘Techniques of focusing’ and ‘Being a field note’, pp. 57–63.
