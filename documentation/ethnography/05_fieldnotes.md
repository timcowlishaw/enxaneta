# _La Pinya_ 05: Fieldnotes

MORE ON ALL OF THIS TO COME.

## Fieldnotes

We'll discuss different strategies and approaches for taking fieldnotes, the role they play in capturing qualitative data, and how they can be used to inform analysis and writing. For this, I'll pull on my own fieldnotes from The World Transformed, some bits from the _Naked Fieldnotes_ book, which is too much to ask you to wade through but has some great weird details.

- Salience hierarchy vs. comprehensive note-taking (cf. Wolfinger 2002).

- Space, actor, activity, object, act, event, time, goal, feeling (Spradley, 1980)

In all of this, we'll draw on your own experiences of observation and note-taking, through the exercises I've thrown at you, while addressing any challenges or questions you may have that emerged from this.


## Mapping core concepts, developing a shared glossary

Shifting this forward from a couple of weeks ago: As a culmination of this first sub-block, we'll briefly review the core concepts discussed in previous sessions (participant observation, thick description, fieldnotes, communities of practice, etc.), with an eye to how these can inform your pilot project with the Colla app.[^1]

I'm also thinking we start to develop a shared glossary of key terms, ensuring that we both have a common understanding of the concepts (across the ethnography and Python components of all this). Is there somewhere persistent this could live, whether on the GitHub, a shared Obsidian vault, or some online canvas? How public do we want this to be?
