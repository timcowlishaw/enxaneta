# _La Pinya_ 05: Fieldnotes

This session looks at strategies, methods, and techniques for taking and working with ethnographic fieldnotes, drawing on insights from various sources and practical exercises. We'll discuss different strategies and approaches for taking fieldnotes, the role they play in capturing qualitative data, and how they can be used to inform analysis and writing. For this, I'll pull on my own fieldnotes from The World Transformed, and relevant sections from the _Naked Fieldnotes_ book (see below). Ultimately, we're looking to support you, as someone new to ethnography, in developing effective fieldnote practices.

## Fieldnotes

> 'Fieldnotes are “good” when they capture more than the banalities of observation, but that “goodness” is always based on their relationship to the fieldwork and the ethnographer’s ability to do something with the fieldnote for other audiences.' (Wolf-Meyer and Elliot 2023: x)

In this session, we'll focus on three broad "types" of fieldnotes:

- Jottings and scratch notes
- "Full" descriptive fieldnotes
- Analytical/methodological/reflexive fieldnotes

In all of this, we'll draw on your own experiences of observation and note-taking, through the exercises I've thrown at you, while addressing any challenges or questions you may have that emerged from this.

> 'there is no one way to write fieldnotes and that many of the expectations that exist — about “good” and “bad” fieldnotes, about varieties of ethnographic writing and their outcomes as texts of various sorts — are disciplinary in their function.' (Wolf-Meyer and Elliot 2023: xix-xx; emphasis mine)

> '[Every] ethnographer is faced with the challenge of finding the appropriate technologies and techniques that support their research goals and accord with their interests and capacities as an observer and writer in a specific situation and environment. _Every fieldnote is a foray into the experimental_.' (Wolf-Meyer and Elliot 2023: xix-xx; emphasis mine)

### Jottings and "scratch notes"

Very brief notes, usually handwritten, comprising what you are able to write down there and then, without breaking the flow of observation. As a researcher, these are "what get you through the day" (Bernard 2017).

The aim is to "freeze and preserve your observations" (Lareau, 2021).

Focus on key words and phrases, often emphasising actions or dialogue. Note time, date, and place before starting. Your aim should be to capture different senses – what you hear, see, smell, etc.

Jottings and scratch notes are often described in mnemonic terms; a seed or surface (?) "around which to collect other remembered incidents" (Emerson et al. 2011). As a prelude to fuller written fieldnotes, they might be usefully considered as providing "focal points for later writing" (ibid.).

Use the "WRITE" mnemonic (Lareau, 2021):

  - W: _"who, what, where, when, how"_
  - R: _reaction_; responses to the action in question
  - I: _inaction_; silence, gaps, nonverbal responses
  - T: _timing_; how slowly or quickly things are happening, pacing, atmospheres
  - E: _emotions_; nonverbal signs of emotion, body language, etc.

What details will help you evoke the setting, physical space, event at a later stage?

### "Full" descriptive fieldnotes

These are detailed accounts of what you observe in the field. They focus on capturing the who, what, when, where, and how of events and interactions.

After an extended session of participant observation (or whatever combination of methods you're using), the aim should be to get back to your desk, and "write up" your observations. Don’t leave it too long! – you need your memories to still be fresh, and falling behind, with a backlog to write up, can be stressful.

It takes a long time! – give it time and space, and only plan to do as much as you can handle, prioritise what seems important.

One possible heuristic: Space, actor, activity, object, act, event, time, goal, feeling (Spradley, 1980).

Break things up; aiming for many small “chunks” of notes, rather than a long, running commentary. (Bernard 2017)

Focus on descriptive notes starting out, but think about techniques to separate your descriptive notes from analytical/methodological/reflexive thoughts (square brackets, boxes, different parts of the page, whatever).

### Analytical/methodological/reflexive notes

Your real-time thoughts and reactions are part of the analytical process, and will come in super-useful later; make sure to include these!

_Analytical_ notes go beyond description to include your initial interpretations, hypotheses, and emerging patterns you notice in the field. What stands out as weird, strange, anomalous – and _why_?

_Methodological_ notes reflect on your research process, including challenges faced, decisions made, and thoughts on course-correction, iteration, or any other changes needed in your approach.

_Reflexive_ notes are personal reflections on your own reactions, biases, and emotional responses to what you're observing. They help maintain awareness of how your own perspective might be influencing your research, and provide handholds for triangulation in later analysis. Some researchers bracket out this reflexive writing into a seperate "journal".

Some researchers also keep a "log" of more practical, logistical details. A record of what you did, where, when, shopping lists, transport timetables, whatever. Alongside these more practical notes, you might also want to hold space to give yourself "marching orders" (after Timmermans and Tavory 2022) – specific aspects to focus on in your next rounds of observation, unanswered questions, quest items, etc.

(It may not always be practical to seperate out these types of notes; they may overlap, or this might not fit with how your brain and attention works, or how you approach a given situation; if you have any strong thoughts or reckons on any of this, let me know, and we can discuss further.)


## _Naked Fieldnotes_ (2023)

This book is great, and _so much better_ than my previous go-to (Sanjek 1990, fwiw). Strongly recommend reading (some of) the following sections, to get a sense of the diversity of strategies different researchers employ:

Its Possible Futures", Matthew J. Wolf-Meyer and Denielle Elliott (ix-xxi)

- "Munich, Blind Activism, Participatory Urban Design, November 2015", Tomás Criado (59-69)
- "Myanmar, Pro-Democracy Movement, Collective Violence, 1998", John Dale (71-84)
- "Costa Rica, Youthhood, Tourism Intimacies, 2015", Susan Frohlick (109-116)

- "Mongolia, Musical Heritage, Wild Horses, 2016–2018", [K. G. Hutchins](https://www.songsforhorses.com/about-me)[^2] (165-170)
- "Pune, Call Centers, Globalization, 2006", Mathangi Krishnamurthy (183-189)
- "Nepal, Roads, Mobility, Graphic Ethnography, 2018", Stacy Leigh Pigg and Shyam Kunwar (231-244)
- "Paignton and Bristol Zoos, Listening to the Zoo Project, 2019", Tom Rice (265-271)
- "Antarctica, Scott Base, Sociality and Extremes, 2017", Richard Vokes (291-300)

## Reflective prompts & questions (once you've read some of the above)

- What does it mean to think about fieldnotes as _evidence_? As "evidentiary documents of everyday life"? (Wolf-Meyer and Elliot 2023: xvi)

- What does it mean to think about fieldnotes as _mnemonic_? What are the advantages or inadequacies of this lens?

- How might the act of taking fieldnotes affect your relationship with participants and your experiences in the field?

- 'Fieldnotes seem to be the thing that reveals to others and ourselves the caliber of our ethnographic skills; they are construed as being an extension of ourselves through the documentation of our empirical skills, our attentions and interests, our ways of navigating relationships and the world.' (Wolf-Meyer and Elliot 2023: ix) Discuss.
