# _La Pinya_ 03: Core Ethnographic Concepts II

Following up on last week, using any further observational exercises you've had chance to do as an platform for discussion of the remaining concepts we didn't address, and some practical reflections on keeping fieldnotes.

<< [Session 2](02_core-ethnographic-concepts.md) | Session 3 >>

## Thick description

Shifting this forward, as we didn't quite get to it last week: Introducing the concept of thick description as a criteria of appraisal. We'll talk a bit about the significance of thick description as a point of differentiation for ethnography, where it fits in the process of ethnographic research, and the importance of fieldnotes in producing such 'thick', detailed accounts.

We'll look at Clifford Geertz's 'Deep play: Notes on the Balinese cock fight'. In this text, Geertz employs thick description to examine the Balinese cockfight, an apparently straightforward blood sport, revealing its deeper cultural meanings and social function (beyond "two roosters fought, and one won"). It'll do me good to re-read this, and after your experiences last week, I'm keen to put this into dialogue with Perec's "[An Attempt at Exhausting A Place in Paris](https://iitcoa3rdyr.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/perec_readings.pdf)" (and his concept of the 'infraordinary'?).

| Some questions |
| ---------------------- |
| - What makes a cultural description "thick" rather than "thin"?
- How does Geertz use thick description to interpret the symbolic meanings of the cockfight? What examples illustrate this?
- How does Geertz balance specific details of the cockfight with broader cultural themes? Does he achieve a meaningful balance?
- Geertz gained the villagers' trust after the police raid. How does the researcher's positionality and level of acceptance influence the quality of participant observation?
- How does Geertz establish his credibility as an interpreter of Balinese culture? How does he handle the tension between being an outsider and an authoritative voice?
- Geertz does not explicitly discuss his fieldnote process. How might he have recorded his observations and experiences during and after the cockfights?
- How would the use of modern technology, such as digital recording devices, change the process and outcomes of ethnographic fieldwork today? |

We can also look at some examples from the Benjamin Bowles article to illustrate how thick description can be used to capture the nuances of social practices, perhaps by exploring the idea of 'enskilment' and how it relates to the concept of 'taskscapes' referenced by Bowles, and tying this to your identified communities of practice (permaculture, Tiny Weird Software, etc.).


## Fieldnotes

We'll discuss different strategies and approaches for taking fieldnotes, the role they play in capturing qualitative data, and how they can be used to inform analysis and writing. For this, I'll pull on some bits from the _Naked Fieldnotes_ book, which too much to ask you to wade through, but has some great weird details.

- Salience hierarchy vs. comprehensive note-taking (cf. Wolfinger 2002).

- Space, actor, activity, object, act, event, time, goal, feeling (Spradley, 1980)

In all of this, we'll draw on your own experiences of observation and note-taking, through the exercises I've thrown at you, while addressing any challenges or questions you may have that emerged from this.


## Mapping core concepts, developing a shared glossary

Again, shifting this forward from last week: As a culmination of this first sub-block, we'll briefly review the core concepts discussed in previous sessions (participant observation, thick description, fieldnotes, communities of practice, etc.), with an eye to how these can inform your pilot project with the Colla app.[^1]

I'm also thinking we start to develop a shared glossary of key terms, ensuring that we both have a common understanding of the concepts (across the ethnography and Python components of all this). Is there somewhere persistent this could live, whether on the GitHub, a shared Obsidian vault, or some online canvas? How public do we want this to be?
