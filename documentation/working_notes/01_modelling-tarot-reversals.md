# Working Notes 1: Modelling Tarot Reversals

In basic terms, I'm currently grappling with how to model card reversals in this weird little shonky tarot-reading prototype Python programme I've been working on. With the Tarot de Marseille as my main go-to, for now, I _think_ I only want reversals to apply to cards in the Major Arcana, based on it being difficult to discern the orientation of the "pips" of the Minor Arcana (?), but this is up for debate.

I'm leaning towards a `Card` object class, as something that supports some of my other plans, and will (I think?) enable tracking and analysis (e.g. percentage of reversed cards in a given spread, different cards' orientations over time). That said, I'm keen to avoid accidentally painting myself into a corner, and want to make sure I haven't overlooked any obvious issues or drawbacks.

Keen to encode Jodorowsky's philosophy into the procedural rhetoric of the model, defaulting to open-ended questions and prompts that encourage self-reflection when a reversal appears, rather than definitive statements. Guide the querent to find their own meaning.

## "Yes, but what _is_ a reversal?"

In tangible terms, reversed cards in a reading are a result of blind shuffling.

Rather than just a upright/reversed binary, reversals gesture to a spectrum of interpretive meanings for each card. A reversal can indicate the energy of the card is blocked, turned inwards, early or late in its appearance, or manifesting in a more challenging or "shadow" form.

I'm interested in modelling reversals in a way that is less about opposition or negativity, and more about a card's _latency_, or hidden properties (blockages, delays, etc.).

It's also about the _relationship_ between reversed and upright cards. If lots of cards are upright, the few reversals stand out more, and vice versa. 

Ways to see through to "the other side", going beyond the limits of the known? A realm of potentials and underlying causes. All a bit subjunctive?

A reminder that situations and energies are not fixed or static, but constantly shifting.

ADDING NUANCE (though: cf. Kieran Healy, "[Fuck Nuance](https://kieranhealy.org/files/papers/fuck-nuance.pdf)").

From an OOO perspective, the reversal activates _a different set of capacities_ within the card-object. The reversed position reconfigures the card's internal composition and its relations to the other cards in the spread, opening up new lines of interpretation and insight.

(Both upright and reversed are sensual surfaces, not the essence itself. Use reversals to challenge the illusion that upright cards are complete manifestations of their archetypes. Every reading is an indirect, imperfect translation of something withdrawn. Let reversals be an invitation to "[apophatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophasis)" interpretation; describing the card by what it is not, gesturing at its ineffable withdrawn essence.)

From this standpoint, the choice to read reversals or not is less about technical proficiency or interpretive sophistication, and more about the reader's orientation to the cards as meaning-making objects. Reading reversals could be seen as a way of _attending to the hidden depths and alternative potentials lurking within each card_ - an invitation to explore the "strange stranger" that withdraws behind the card's surface meanings.

If the upright card represents one set of attributes, a reversal is one of multiple possible lenses transforming that set. The interpretive challenge is in figuring out which transformations should be applied, through querent input and contextual analysis.

James Ricklef's "Five Ds": 1. _Delay_ of the original effect; 2. _Diminuation_ of the original effect; 3. _Direct opposite_ of the original meaning; 4. _Dark side_ of the original meaning; 5. _Direction change_.

> 'Problems ... represent energy that is constrained and can be liberated.' (Greer 2002)

> 'Since both upright and reversed images are part of the card's energy, its full range is there for you to access, but it may feel like jumping a hurdle or walking through molasses.' (Greer 2002)

> 'In general, it helps to think of reversed cards as "red flagged," indicating that you should pay extra attention to them. They signal that something is not operating as usual. Upright cards tend to be conscious, outer, automatic, in process, and available. Reversed cards often indicate choice points, where you must be attentive. They may require conscientious, willful handling if you are to take full advantage of the energies and opportunities. It is like knowing that a car has a tendency to pull to the right and so you have to keep alert and make adjustments for it. Or they are places to stop struggling, relax, and let go of all expectations.' (Greer 2002: 25)

## 12 main ways to read reversals (after Greer 2002); of which the following 10 are relevant to us:

### 1. **Blocked, Resisted**

> 'The energy normally described by the card may be blocked, repressed, denied, rejected, or resisted.' (Greer 2002)

[Obstacles, hindrances, and resistance to the card's energy.] ["Blocked", "Stuck", "Stymied", "Thwarted", "Struggled with", "Denied", "Avoided", "Defied", "Resisted", "Repressed", "Refused", "Rejected"]

In an object-oriented `Card` class model, this could be represented through a `reversed` boolean attribute that, when `True`, triggers an alternate set of meanings or interpretations associated with blockage or resistance. These alternate meanings could be stored as additional attributes on the Card object, such as `blocked_meaning` or `resisted_archetype`, paralleling the standard `meaning` and `archetype` attributes.

_Alternatively_, the `Card` class could include methods like `meaning()` and `archetype()` that return different values based on the state of the reversed attribute, encapsulating the reversal logic.

In a procedural model like a tuple `(card, reversed)`, this negation operation could be applied when the `reversed` boolean is `True`, perhaps via a function like `apply_reversal(meaning)` that takes a base meaning and returns its negated or inverted form.

- [?] These two approaches are essentially equivalent, right?

Procedurally, applying this technique would involve an additional step in the interpretation process, where the reversal status of each card is checked and the appropriate negation or inversion operation is applied to generate the final reversed meaning. This additional reversal step could be encapsulated in the `Card` class methods or in standalone functions, depending on the overall architecture of the program. 

Interpreting a spread with multiple reversed cards would involve repeatedly applying this negation procedure to each card's base meanings, then synthesising the results into a coherent interpretation. Tracking the history of a card's reversals over multiple readings could yield interesting insights into patterns of blockage or resistance over time.

### 2. **Projected**

> 'There could be a tendency to project denied material onto others. These may be qualities you admire as well as those you do not like.' (Greer 2002)

[Psychological mirroring, reflecting denied or disowned aspects of the self.] ["Projected"]

**Summary**: Reversals as a kind of psychological mirror, reflecting aspects of the self that are denied or disowned. Each card contains within itself a set of potential projections: qualities that we may see in others but fail to recognise in ourselves. The reversal acts as a kind of flip, _turning the card's energy outward_ rather than inward. Procedurally, the interpretation of a reversed card should involve a kind of psychological mirroring or reflection process, where the qualities of the card are examined as potential projections of the querent.

In an object-oriented Card class model, this could be represented through a `projected_attributes` property that holds an array of qualities associated with the card when reversed. These attributes would be distinct from the card's core `attributes`, representing a shadow or denied aspect of the self. The `projected_attributes` could include both positive and negative traits. For example, the reversed King of Wands might have projected_attributes like `["confident", "arrogant", "passionate", "impulsive"]`.

In a procedural model, this could involve a `project_attributes(querent)` method on the `Card` class that compares the `projected_attributes` to the `querent` object's own attributes (!!!), looking for matches or discrepancies. This method could return a interpretation string highlighting any projections. 

Applying this technique would involve an additional step in the interpretation process, where each reversed card is examined for potential projections based on the querent's psychological profile. This profile could be gathered through an initial intake form (YIKES) or dynamically throughout the reading.

### 3. **Delayed, Difficult, Unavailable**

> 'There could be hesitation, uncertainty, unavailability, or an external delay. With many cards reversed, overall change may take longer that expected.' (Greer 2002)

[Temporal challenges, delays, and difficulties in manifesting the card's energy.] ["Delayed", "Hestitated", "Held back", "Set back", "Made difficult", "Rough road", "Indecisive", "Distracted", "Obstructed", "Hindered", "Suspended", "Inhibited", "Turned away from"]

**Summary**: Reversals as modifiers of the card's temporal unfolding or accessibility, rather than negations of its fundamental meaning. Each card contains latent potentials that may be delayed, made difficult, or rendered temporarily unavailable by a reversal. The reversal doesn't negate the card's core meaning, but rather modifies the ease and timeline of its manifestation. The querent's actions and choices can impact the degree of delay or difficulty, with 'negative' reversals as temporary challenges rather than permanent, immutable obstacles.

This framing implies that the querent's actions and choices can impact the degree of delay or difficulty, and that 'negative' reversals may be temporary challenges rather than permanent, immutable obstacles. The data model could reflect this by allowing reversal attributes to be updated based on the querent's evolving context.

In an object-oriented `Card` class model, this could be represented through attributes like `delay`, `difficulty`, or `availability`, which could hold values indicating the degree or nature of the impediment (lol).

Reversal attributes could be set based on the specific reversal keyword, e.g., `card.set_reversal('delay', 'Hesitated')`, allowing for nuanced descriptions of the blockage.

In a procedural model, this could involve applying functions like `delay()`, `make_difficult()`, or `make_unavailable()` to the card's upright meaning, based on the specific reversal keyword.

The interpretation could also suggest potential actions or choices the querent could make to overcome the delay or difficulty, based on the specific nature of the blockage. For example, a "Hesitated" reversal might prompt the querent to examine and overcome their indecision, while an "Obstructed" reversal might suggest identifying and removing external barriers.

In a multi-card spread, the presence of multiple reversals with delay or difficulty keywords could suggest a slowdown in the querent's progress or development. The program could track the frequency and severity of such reversals across readings to identify persistent patterns of blockage.

### 4. **Inner, Unconscious, Private**

> 'The energy might be unconscious, inner, or private rather than conscious, outer, or public.' (Greer 2002)

[Internal, hidden, or unconscious aspects of the card's energy.] ["Inner", "Inward", "Unconscious", "Internal", "Personal", "Private", "Deep", "Secret", "Covert", "Unexpressed", "Indirect", "Underground", "Underlying", "Concealed", "Unseen", "Beneath", "Below"]

**Summary**: Reversals as pointers to the querent's inner world, in contrast to the outer, public face represented by upright cards. The technique maps the tarot system onto a model of the psyche, with upright cards representing conscious phenomena and reversals representing the unconscious. Procedurally, interpreting a reversed card as "inner, unconscious, private" involves a kind of psychological mirroring or reflection, where the card's energy is understood as an internal state or process of the querent.

In an object-oriented `Card` class model, this could be represented through a `facing` attribute with values like `"upright"`, `"reversed"`, `"inner"`, `"outer"`, etc. The facing would indicate the ontological status of the card's energy - whether it manifests internally or externally. Alternatively, a `reversed_meaning` attribute could hold interpretations specific to the inner/unconscious reading, distinct from the upright meaning. This separates the two ontological realms. (I think this is too binary?)

In a procedural model, this could involve functions like `interiorise()` or `reflect()` that transform the card's upright meaning into a statement about the querent's inner world, e.g., `interiorise("Creative abundance")` yields `"In your inner world, creative abundance"`.

### 5. **Breaking Through, Overturning, Refusing, Changing Direction**

> 'The querent could be overturning, getting out from under, breaking free of, rejecting, refusing, or turning away from the condition pictured. It can also show the end of passing away of a situation, a loosening, or a change in direction.' (Greer 2002)

[Transformative thresholds, pivotal choice points, and active change.] ["Overturned", "Overthrown", "Overcome", "Broken through", "Put down", "Changed", "Adjusted", "Toppled", "Out from under", "Falling away", "Unseated", "Breached", "Loosened", "Freed", "Released"]

**Summary**: Reversals as transformative thresholds or pivotal choice points. Ontographically, this frames the tarot reading as a space of potential transformation, where each reversed card is a fork in the path, inviting the querent to overturn old patterns or change direction. Reversals mark points of instability where new possibilities can emerge through the querent's active choices. Procedurally, interpreting a reversal as "breaking through" or "changing direction" involves identifying the querent's current relationship to the upright meaning, and then signaling a potential point of departure or transformation.

This technique aligns with an ontology of becoming and emergence, where the querent's engagement with the cards' energies is fluid and dynamic. The spread maps a landscape of thresholds and pivotal moments. Reversals mark points of instability where new possibilities can emerge through the querent's active choices (yesssss). Philosophically, it resonates with ideas of radical freedom and self-creation, framing the querent as an agent actively shaping their path, not just passively receiving the cards' meanings. The reversal is an invitation to overturn determinism.

In an object-oriented model, this could be represented through a `reversed_action` attribute on the Card class, holding values like `"overturning"`, `"breaking free"`, `"rejecting"`, `"turning away"`, etc. This attribute signifies the querent's active stance towards the card's energy.

In a procedural model, this could involve functions like `assess_relationship()` and `propose_reversal()` that analyse the querent's situation and suggest potential reversed meanings.

Applying this technique would involve first calling `assess_relationship()` to diagnose the querent's current state, then feeding that into `propose_reversal()` to generate the specific reversal interpretation, e.g. "breaking free from limitation". The reading becomes a springboard for embodied change.

### 6. **No or Not (the upright meaning); Lacking**

> 'Occasionally you can preface a standard upright interpretation with "no" or "not." Or try adding prefixes such as "non-" or "un-" to upright meanings. ... Take care that this does not lead to a judgemental, overly deterministic, or negative attitude.' (Greer 2002)

[Binary negation or absence of the card's core qualities.] ["No", "Not", "Negated", "Inverse of", "Lacking", "Absent", "Without", "Ended", "End of", "Discontinued"]

**Summary**: Reversals as a kind of binary switch, toggling between the presence and absence of a card's core qualities. Each card's meaning oscillates between its upright significance and its negation, with no intermediate states. The reversal flips the card's polarity. Procedurally, interpreting a reversal as "No or Not (the upright meaning)" involves a straightforward negation operation. Perhaps best understood as a kind of "ground level" of reversal, a _first approximation_ of the card's inverted meaning that sets the stage for deeper, more individualised interpretations to emerge, in dialogue with the querent. A practical entry point to begin grappling with the tarot's inverted meanings.

Ontographically, this technique maps the tarot's symbolic world onto a binary space of presence and absence. (However, this binary ontology risks reducing the tarot's symbolic richness to a series of on/off switches, losing sight of more subtle shades of significance.)

In an object-oriented `Card` class model, this could be represented through a reversed boolean attribute. When `True`, the card's meaning would be interpreted as the negation of its upright attributes.

Procedurally, the program would prepend "No" or "Not" to the card's upright meaning, or add negating prefixes like "non-" or "un-" to key terms. In a procedural model, this could be implemented as a `negate()` function that takes the upright meaning string and returns its negated form.

Applying this technique would involve checking the `reversed` attribute of each card and, if `True`, passing its `upright_meaning` through the `negate()` function to generate the reversed interpretation. This negation operation could be extended with more sophisticated natural language processing techniques, such as identifying and negating key sentiment words or phrases within the upright meaning. (However, as Greer cautions, this mechanical negation risks generating interpretations that are overly machinic or pessimistic. The program may need to incorporate additional heuristics to maintain a balanced perspective.)

The program could also track the frequency of negated interpretations across a reading and provide compensatory prompts for reflection if they exceed a certain threshold, to avoid an overly negative tone (rofl).

### 7. **Excessive, Over- or Undercompensating**

> 'The reversal may intensify or lessen the meaning of the card, or take it to extremes and overindulgence: too little or too much, under or overdeveloped, immature or senile. In pyschological terms it can indicate over- or undercompensation, or a tendency to flip dramatically between polarities.' (Greer 2002)

[Spectrum of intensity, over- or under-expression of the card's energy.] ["Too much", "Too strong", "Overwhelmed", "Overly", "Excessive", "Exaggerated", "Intensified", "Overindulged",  "Ungrounded", "Out of control", "Tentative", "Toned down", "Softened", "Embryonic", "Too little", "Lessened", "Narrowed"]

**Summary**: Reversals as a spectrum of intensity, rather than a binary state. Ontographically, it frames the tarot reading as a landscape of energetic intensities, with each card manifesting its archetypal meaning to a greater or lesser degree. The spread becomes a map of imbalances and compensations (_nice_). This aligns with an ontology of the psyche as a dynamic system seeking equilibrium. Reversals represent over- or under-compensations in that system, pointing to areas of excessive or deficient expression. Procedurally, interpreting a reversal as "excessive" or "deficient" involves scaling the intensity of the card's core meaning up or down, based on the degree of reversal.

In an object-oriented `Card` class model, this could be represented through an intensity attribute, perhaps an integer or enum type, indicating the degree of over- or under-expression of the card's energy.

In a procedural model, this could involve functions like `intensify()` or `diminish()` that modify the card's upright meaning based on its intensity attribute. Applying this technique would involve setting the `intensity` attribute of reversed cards, then calling the `interpret()` function to generate the modified meaning.

The interpretation could suggest reflections or actions to bring the energy into balance, based on whether it is excessive or deficient. For example, an excessively assertive King of Wands might prompt the querent to practice humility and collaboration (lol).

In a multi-card spread, the program could appraise the overall balance of intensities, highlighting areas of overcompensation or deficiency in the querent's life. It could suggest practices to harmonise these energies.
Over a series of readings, the program could track the querent's progress in balancing the energies of frequently reversed cards, offering guidance and affirmation.

### 8. **Misused or Misdirected**

> 'Misfiring, misuse, or misdirection implies a faulty start, bad timing, or something that is not used appropriately. … Try other forms of the prefix mis-.' (Greer 2002)

[Distortion or deviation from the card's true nature.] ["Misused", "Misdirected", "Misplaced", "Mistrust", "Mishap", "Mistaken", "Miss", "Instability", "Irresponsible", "Problematic", "Inappropriate"]

**Summary**: Reversals as a kind of distortion or deviation from the card's "true" nature. Each reversed card represents a point where the querent's application of that energy has gone awry. This aligns with an ontology that sees the tarot archetypes as having true, essential natures that can be misapplied through human error or misunderstanding. Reversals represent a departure from the card's authentic expression. Procedurally, interpreting a reversal as "misused" or "misdirected" involves identifying how the card's upright energy is being misapplied in the querent's situation, and suggesting corrective actions.

Ontographically, this frames the tarot reading as a landscape of potential misalignments. The spread becomes a map of areas needing correction or realignment.

It also resonates with the idea of the "shadow" in Jungian psychology, where unintegrated aspects of the psyche can manifest in distorted or problematic ways. Reversals could represent the querent's shadow energies needing integration.

In an object-oriented `Card` class model, this could be represented through a `misuse_type` attribute, perhaps an enum or string, indicating the specific way the card's energy is being misapplied.

In a procedural model, this could involve functions like `diagnose_misuse()` and `suggest_realignment()` that analyse the querent's situation and propose ways to redirect the card's energy. Applying this technique would involve first calling `diagnose_misuse()` to identify the specific way the card's energy is being misapplied, then passing that to `suggest_realignment()` to generate advice for the querent.

The interpretation could draw on a knowledge base of common misuses and misdirections associated with each card, and corresponding corrective actions. For example, the reversed Chariot might suggest the querent is misusing their willpower to control others rather than master themselves.

Over a series of readings, the program could track patterns in the querent's misuses, offering insights into recurring shadow tendencies or areas for growth. It could celebrate when previously misused energies show up in upright positions, reflecting successful integration (lol what, imagining a confetti animation).

Modelling this in the data structures and algorithms of the tarot program would position Querent.py as a kind of "wise friend" or mentor, helping the querent recognise where they've gone off track and gently guiding them back to the authentic expression of each card's highest potential. (Bit paternalistic?)

### 9. **"Re-" Words: Retried, Retracted, Reviewed, Reconsidered**

> 'Reversals immediate suggest other "re-" words such as those above. The prefix "re-" denotes backward motion, withdrawal, opposition, negation, or to do again.' (Greer 2002)

[Reflection, correction, and reevaluation.] ["Retreated", "Reconsidered", "Reviewed", "Retracted", "Retrograde", "Reverse direction", "Rectified", "Relieved", "Relaxed", "Returned", "Renewed", "Remedied", "Rectified", "Relieved", "Redeemed", "Corrected", "Countered"]

**Summary**: Reversals as markers of change, correction, or opposition to the card's initial state. Each reversed card represents a point of reflection or course correction in relation to the upright meaning. Reversals mark moments of opposition and negation spurring reevaluation. Reversals prompt the querent to revisit their assumptions, reconsider their actions, and potentially change course. Each reversal becomes an invitation to look again with fresh eyes, charting a new course if needed.

(It's kind of processual?) Ontographically, this frames the tarot reading as a space of potential revision and reconsideration. This aligns with an ontology of change and process, where the meanings of the cards are not fixed but subject to ongoing adjustment.

In an object-oriented `Card` class model, this could be represented through a `reversed_action` attribute, perhaps an enum or string, indicating the specific "re-" action associated with the reversal.

Procedurally, interpreting a reversal as a "re-" action involves identifying the initial upright meaning, and then applying the specific "re-" operation to generate the reversed interpretation. In a procedural model, this could involve functions like `apply_reversal()` that take the upright meaning and the "re-" action and return the modified interpretation.

Applying this technique would involve setting the reversed_action attribute of reversed cards, then calling `apply_reversal()` with the card's `upright_meaning` and `reversed_action` to generate the interpretation. The interpretation could suggest reflections or actions for the querent to take in light of the "re-" action. For example, a "reconsidered" reversal might prompt the querent to question their assumptions about the upright meaning.

Procedurally, this technique lends itself to an iterative, dialogic model of tarot reading, where the interpretation of a card is not a one-time event but an ongoing process of reflection and revision. Each reversal becomes an invitation to look again, charting a new course if needed.

### 10. **Unconventional, Shamanic, Magical, Humorous**

> 'If an upright card depicts conventional wisdom, then the reversal illustrates unconventional wisdom. It quests all the assumptions indicated by the upright meaning. It is not straight, but crooked and crazy. Each card has a place that you can "see through and into." you have to look under the mask of what "seems to be." Thus there could be a trickster aspect to a reversed card. Perhaps a sense of humour is required; you are being instructed not to take the situation too seriously. … The shamanic or magical view, in particular, asks you to enter the card and journey to an Alice-in-Wonderland realm in order to bring back a vital message or understanding.' (Greer 2002)

[Subversion, unconventional wisdom, and Trickster energy.] ["Humorous", "Trickster", "Coyote", "Joke", "Topsy-turvy", "See through", "Unconventional", "Contrary", "Subverted", "Iconoclastic", "Crooked", "Baffled", "Twisted", "New Perspective"]

**Summary**: Reversed cards as a subversion or inversion of conventional wisdom, revealing hidden or unconventional truths. Reversals serve as indicators that we need to question our assumptions and look beyond the obvious. This resonates with the Jungian concept of the Trickster archetype, a boundary-crossing figure who subverts norms and reveals unexpected insights. Reversed cards may embody this Trickster energy, playfully challenging our preconceptions. Procedurally, interpreting a reversal through this lens involves a kind of perspectival shift or cognitive reframing. The querent is invited to step outside their conventional viewpoint and entertain a radically different, even humorous or absurd, perspective.

Ontographically, this frames the tarot reading as a liminal space where conventional meanings can be overturned, and hidden wisdom can emerge. This aligns with an ontology that sees reality as multi-layered, with surface appearances masking deeper, often paradoxical truths.

In an object-oriented `Card` class model, this could be represented through a `reversed_perspective` attribute, perhaps a string or array, holding the unconventional or trickster-like meanings associated with the card's reversal.

In a procedural model, this could involve functions like `conventional_meaning()` and `unconventional_meaning()` that return different interpretations based on the card's reversal status. Applying this technique would involve first setting the `reversed_perspective` attribute with an appropriate unconventional meaning, then calling the `unconventional_meaning()` function for reversed cards.

The interpretation might encourage the querent to question their assumptions, look for humor in the situation, or embrace a "crooked" path. Procedurally, this technique lends itself to a more open-ended, exploratory style of tarot reading, where unexpected insights are welcomed and conventional meanings are held lightly.

## Prototyping

### Key Considerations:

1. Presenting multiple reversal interpretations to the querent can provide rich insights but risks cognitive overload. An iterative, dialogic approach can help manage this complexity (are there other ways?).
2. Combining complementary techniques into more abstract transformations can strike a balance between interpretive richness and coherence. This requires careful analysis of the techniques' underlying principles.
3. The overall goal is to scaffold the querent's own meaning-making process, eliciting their reflections and associations to populate an evolving personal dictionary. The data model should be designed to support this incremental growth.
4. Refactoring the `Card` class and data model to accommodate multiple reversal techniques is best approached iteratively, allowing for testing and reflection at each stage.

### Potential approach

1. Analyse the 10 techniques to identify underlying principles and complementarities. For example, "Blocked/Resisted" and "Delayed/Difficult" both involve a hindrance to the card's energy, while "Inner/Unconscious" and "Projected" both deal with psychological dimensions.
2. Based on this analysis, develop a set of more abstract reversal transformations that combine related techniques.
3. Refactor the `Card` class to include these abstract transformations as optional attributes, each pointing to a dictionary of the relevant techniques and their generated interpretations.
4. Develop an interactive dialogue system that presents the querent with the abstract transformations relevant to their drawn card(s), based on some initial criteria (e.g., the querent's situation, the spread position meaning, etc.).
5. For each selected transformation, guide the querent through a series of prompts and questions to elicit their reflections, associations, and interpretations. Use this input to generate personalised reversal interpretations using the underlying techniques.
6. Present the querent with the generated interpretations, highlighting complementarities and tensions between the different techniques. Encourage further reflection and refinement.
7. Store the querent's finalised interpretations, associations, and reflections in their personal dictionary, linked to the relevant `Card` and transformation. Over time, this dictionary becomes a rich resource for personalised readings.
8. Iterate on the `Card` class and data model design based on insights from implementing and testing this dialogue system. Refine the abstract transformations and data structures as needed to better support the querent's meaning-making process.

### Challenges

- Balancing structure and openness to guide the querent's reflections while allowing for emergent insights
- Managing the complexity of multiple transformations and techniques in the user interface and data model
- Developing natural language processing capabilities to generate meaningful interpretations from the querent's input
- Ensuring the evolving personal dictionary remains coherent and navigable over time
- Designing for the edge cases of contradictory or incompatible interpretations across techniques

## Prototyping In-Progress

```python
class Card:
    def __init__(self, name, upright_meaning):
        self.name = name
        self.upright_meaning = upright_meaning
        self.reversed = False
        self.negation = None # Do we need a seperate negation attribute, or could this be inferred from the reversed Boolean, if no other reversal/transformation attributes are active?
        self.obstruction = None
        self.imbalance = None
        self.shadow = None
        self.transformation = None
        self.subversion = None

    def generate_reversal(self, transformation, technique, querent_input)
        # Generate reversal interpretation based on technique and querent input
        # Store in the relevant transformation dictionary
        self.transformation[technique] = interpretation
```

### Transformations

I think we're going to try modelling 6x broad transformations, bundling related techniques identified by Mary Greer under headings of "negation" (the "ground level" or baseline transformation), "obstruction", "imbalance", "shadow", "transformation", and "subversion" (a wildcard).

#### 1. "Negation" ("No/Not/Lacking")

Negation suggests a binary switch or toggle, where the reversed meaning is a direct inversion or absence of the upright. Modeling this could involve a boolean `reversed` attribute on the `Card` class, which, when `True`, negates or nullifies the upright meaning.

The program would present reversed cards as negations of their upright meanings, suggesting a clear inversion or lack. Querent interactions would involve grappling with the implications of this absence or opposition, considering what's missing or contrary to their expectations.

e.g. If the upright Empress represents abundance and nurturing, a "negated" reversal would be interpreted as "No abundance" or "Lacking nurturing." The querent would be prompted to reflect on areas of scarcity or deficiency in their life related to the Empress's themes.

e.g. If the upright Chariot represents forward momentum and control, a Negation reversal might suggest "Lack of direction" or "Loss of control". The program could prompt the querent to reflect on areas where they feel directionless or powerless.

Ontographically, this technique maps the tarot's symbolic world onto a binary space of presence and absence.[^1]

```python
class Card:
    def __init__(self, name, upright_meaning):
        self.name = name
        self.upright_meaning = upright_meaning
        self.reversed = False

    def meaning(self):
        if self.reversed:
            return f"No {self.upright_meaning}" or f"Lacking {self.upright_meaning}" # Maybe we need to use the keywords?
        else:
            return self.upright_meaning
```

Using a Boolean aligns with the ontological framing of reversals as a binary switch, toggling between the presence and absence of a card's core qualities. It's a straightforward way to represent the negation technique within the object-oriented structure of the `Card` class.

Reason to model reversals-as-negations with an attribute rather than a function, at least initially, is because we want querent-elicted interpretations and associations to get "attached" to the card; latent but remembered, available for future retrieval.

If this a "ground level" reversal, a _first approximation_ of the card's inverted meaning, as a placeholder and prelude to greater semantic (?) resolution or fidelity to the situation at-hand, I guess we're looking at a `negate()` function, appending "no", "not", "non-", "un-" or "lacking" to the `upright_meaning` or default keyword strings, which then get shown to the querent as a dialogue prompt? A practical entry point, this is the "baseline" interpretive procedure/operation from which the other transformations depart.

#### 2. "Obstruction" (Blocked/Resisted + Delayed/Difficult)

Obstruction implies a hindrance or barrier to the (easy, timely) manifestation/expression of the upright meaning. The reversed card's energy is present but impeded. Modeling this will probably involve including an `obstruction` attribute on the `Card` class, which could be an enum or a string indicating the type of obstruction (e.g., "DELAYED", "THWARTED", "GATED", "UNAVAILABLE"[^2]).

The `meaning()` method could be modified to return different interpretations based on the obstruction attribute's value, encapsulating the reversal logic within the method? When interpreting a reversed card, the program would first check the `obstruction` attribute to determine the type of obstruction. Based on the obstruction type, the program would apply the corresponding operation to the card's base, upright `meaning` (or `archetype`?).

The program would frame reversed cards as temporary challenges rather than permanent, immutable obstacles. Querent interactions would involve identifying and engaging with these barriers. The program should emphasise the querent's agency and ability to overcome blockages and delays. This could be based on predefined mappings between obstruction types and suggested actions, presented as prompts or questions.

e.g. An obstructed Chariot might be interpreted as "Progress blocked" or "Victory delayed." The querent would be guided to consider what internal or external factors are impeding their forward momentum, and how they might work through these challenges.

```python
card = Card("The Chariot", "Willpower, determination, victory")
card.set_reversal(True)
card.set_obstruction(ObstructionType.BLOCKED, "Feeling stuck, lack of progress")

print(card.get_meaning())
# Output: Blocked: Feeling stuck, lack of progress
```

The program could also track the presence and frequency of obstructions across a querent's multiple readings, identifying recurring patterns of blockage or delay and offer insights or recommendations based on these patterns.

#### 3. "Imbalance" (Misused/Misdirected + Excessive/Over/Undercompensating)

Imbalance points to a distortion or misapplication of the card's upright energy. The reversal isn't a negation but a deviation from the ideal expression, suggesting a need for recalibration. Modeling this could use a `imbalance` attribute.

Could define an `imbalance` enum to represent the different types of imbalance (e.g., "MISUSED", "MISDIRECTED", "EXCESSIVE", "DEFICIENT", "NARROW", "UNSTABLE", "INAPPROPRIATE"), providing a structured way to categorise and interpret the nature of the imbalance in reversed cards.

Could include a `diagnose_imbalance()` (`discern_imbalance`?) function that analyses the querent's situation and the card's upright meaning to determine the specific type of imbalance present in a reversed card. This could involve a dialogic interaction with the querent, or pattern matching against common misuses or misdirections associated with each card.

```python
def diagnose_imbalance(card, querent_situation):
    # Review querent_situation and card.upright_meaning
    # to determine the type of imbalance
    # Return an Imbalance enum value
    pass
```

```python
def interpret_imbalance(card):
    if card.imbalance == Imbalance.MISUSED:
        return f"{card.name}'s energy of {card.upright_meaning} may be misused or misapplied. Consider how to redirect this energy more constructively."
    elif card.imbalance == Imbalance.EXCESSIVE:
        return f"An excessive or overcompensating expression of {card.name}'s {card.upright_meaning}. Reflect on where you may need to scale back or find balance."
    # ... handle other Imbalance types
```

Ontographically, this transformation frames the tarot reading as a landscape of energetic intensities and/or potential misalignments. The spread becomes a map of imbalances and compensations, pointing to areas of excessive, deficient, or misapplied expression, needing correction or realignment. Each reversed card represents a point where the application that energy has gone awry.

The program will present reversed cards as imbalanced expressions of their upright qualities, inviting the querent to consider where and what they may be over- or under-doing.

e.g. An excessively imbalanced Hermit might be interpreted as "Excessive isolation." The querent would be prompted to reflect on where they may be taking the Hermit's qualities of solitude and introspection to an unhealthy extreme.

#### 4. "Shadow" (Projected + Inner/Unconscious/Private)

Shadow suggests the reversal turns the card's energy inward, pointing to unconscious or shadow aspects of the querent's psyche. It sets up a distinction between the external and the internal, the conscious and the unconscious. Modeling this could use a `shadow` attribute.

The program would frame reversed cards as reflections of the querent's inner state or unacknowledged projections. Interactions would involve introspection and shadow work.

```python
def interiorise(self, card_meaning):
    return f"In your inner world, {card_meaning.lower()}" # "Lower"? No idea what's going on here
```

In a procedural model, this could involve a `project_attributes(querent)` method on the `Card` class that compares the `projected_attributes` to the `querent` object's own attributes (!!!), looking for matches or discrepancies. This method could return a interpretation string highlighting any projections.

e.g. A shadow reversal of the Lovers might be interpreted as "Unconsciously projecting relationship ideals" or "Inner conflicts around partnership." The querent would be guided to examine their own unacknowledged desires and fears around love and intimacy.

**Alternatively**: Instead of representing the querent's personal shadow, reversed cards could point to collective or archetypal shadow energies associated with the card. This frames reversals as portals into the universal unconscious, rather than the querent's private psyche. In the data model, this could be represented through a `shadow_archetype` attribute on the `Card` class, holding a symbolic description of the card's reversed meaning, e.g., "Repressed creativity", "Unacknowledged grief", "Denied power".[^3]

Interpreting a reversal would involve looking up the card's shadow_archetype and reflecting on how that archetypal energy might be manifesting in the user's situation, without requiring direct psychological analysis. Reversed cards could be treated as invitations for the querent to dialogue with the shadow archetype.

This positions the reading as a dialogue between the user's conscious situation and the deeper archetypal energies in play. The spread becomes a map of the interplay between light and shadow.

**Or**: Even more broadly, this transformation could access "hidden" or "latent" dimensions of the cards upright meaning? We'd need to give some thought to what this might look like in practice; perhaps using enums (e.g. "DEEP", "CONCEALED", "UNEXPRESSED", "INDIRECT", "UNDERGROUND").

#### 5. "Transformation" (Breaking Through/Overturning + "Re-" Words)

Transformation frames reversals as catalysts for change and/or reorientation, pivots or turning points where old patterns can be overturned. The querent might be getting out from under, breaking free of, rejecting, refusing, or turning away from the energy or condition depicted. It could also designate the end or passing of a situation, a loosening, or change in direction. The transformation operation (?) emphasises process over state, framing the upright and reversed meanings as part of an ongoing evolution. A reversed card becomes a fork in the path, inviting the querent to overturn old patterns or correct course.

The technique frames reversals as markers of instability and potential transformation, aligning with an ontology of becoming and emergence. The meanings of the cards are fluid and dynamic. How do we model this fluidity in the data structure? Should we allow for multiple, context-dependent interpretations of each reversal, and if so, how do we manage the resulting complexity?

This could involve adding a `transformation` attribute to the `Card` class, which could be an enum or string indicating the specific type of transformative energy associated with the reversal (e.g., "TOPPLING", "BREAKING_THROUGH", "LOOSENING", "RETRACTING", "RECONSIDERING", "REDEEMING"[^4]). 

**Alternatively**: We could use a boolean `catalyst` attribute (or similar) to signal whether the reversal represents a transformative catalyst, and then determine the specific transformation type procedurally based on the card's other attributes and the querent's situation.

```python
    def apply_reversal(self, relationship):
        if self.catalyst:
            if relationship == "stuck":
                return f"Breaking free from limitation: {self.upright_meaning}"
            elif relationship == "resisting":
                return f"Overturning resistance: {self.upright_meaning}"
            # Add other relationship mappings as needed
        else:
            return f"Reconsidering: {self.upright_meaning}"
```

(I like this. Three pipes, for example, with a default. How to make these pipes sufficiently chunky?)

**Or**: Implement an `assess_relationship()` function that takes the querent's situation (perhaps as a string or a more structured object) and the card's upright meaning, and returns a description of the querent's current relationship to that energy (e.g., "stuck", "resisting", "outgrowing"). Then create a `propose_reversal()` function that takes the querent's current relationship to the upright meaning (from `assess_relationship()`) and generates a transformative reversal interpretation.

Procedurally, interpreting a reversal as "breaking through" or "changing direction" involves identifying the querent's current relationship to the upright meaning, and then signaling a potential point of departure or transformation. Ontographically, this frames the tarot reading as a space of potential revision and reconsideration. This aligns with an ontology of change and process, where the meanings of the cards are not fixed but subject to ongoing adjustment.

```python
querent_context = "Feeling stuck in a rut"
transformed_card = card.transformation(querent_context)
print(transformed_card.reversed_meaning)
```

How to structure the program's elicitation of `querent_context`, before or through the reading?

```python
    def assess_relationship(self, querent_input):
        # Placeholder for assessing the querent's relationship to the upright meaning
        # This could involve NLP techniques or predefined mappings
        return "stuck"  # Example output

    def propose_reversal(self, relationship):
        if relationship == "stuck":
            return TransformationType.BREAKING_THROUGH
        elif relationship == "resisting":
            return TransformationType.OVERTURNING
        # Add other mappings as needed
```

The program would present reversed cards as invitations or opportunities for growth and change. Querent interactions would focus on identifying and engaging with these transformative openings. The program should facilitate this active engagement, providing tools and prompts that empower the querent to explore and enact transformative changes.

e.g. A "reconsidering" reversal of the Tower might be interpreted as "Reconsidering upheaval" or "Revelation reconsidered." The querent would be prompted to reflect on the value (or not) of Tower's disruptive energy at this point in time.[^5]

```python
tower_card = Card("The Tower", "Upheaval", "Revelation", "Awakening") # How will the card  handle keywords?
tower_card.set_transformation_type("reconsidering")
querent_state = "feeling trapped"
if tower_card.assess_relationship(querent_state):
    reversed_interpretation = tower_card.propose_reversal()
    print(reversed_interpretation) # Example output: "Reconsidering upheaval: The Tower suggests reconsidering sudden change.
```

Philosophically, this operation resonates with ideas of self-creation, framing the querent as an agent actively shaping their path, not just passively receiving the cards' meanings. The "transformation" reversal is a "clinamen", an invitation to overturn determinism.

- How do we encode the specific actions or reflections associated with each transformation type? Should these be predefined or generated dynamically (procedurally?) based on the querent's input?
- How do we guide the querent through the process of identifying their relationship to the upright meaning and proposed transformation? Should we use a decision tree, an iterative dialogue, or another method to scaffold this interaction?

#### 6. "Subversion" (Unconventional/Shamanic)

Subversion positions reversals as challenges to conventional wisdom, revealing unexpected, oblique, or even absurd perspectives. It emphasises the contextual fluidity of interpretation, and the value of unorthodox insight.

Operationalising the trickster archetype and/or shamanic wisdom is no mean feat.

We could implement a `subversion` attribute on the `Card` class to store unconventional or trickster-like meanings associated with reversals. This could be a string, array, or even a nested object with multiple subversive interpretations.

We might want a function or method to generate subversive reversal interpretations based on the upright meaning. This could involve:

- Identifying and inverting key concepts or assumptions in the upright meaning
- Applying humour, irony, or absurdity to the upright meaning[^6]
- Drawing from a predefined set of unconventional or trickster-like archetypes or themes

We want a function that takes the upright meaning as an input, and returns a subverted or ironised version. Juxtaposition, exaggeration, reframing, alternative viewpoints?

Are we looking at a predefined dictionary of subversive interpretations?

```python
def subvert_meaning(card, upright_meaning, querent_input):
    subversions = {
        "The Fool": [
            "The wisdom of folly: embracing the unknown with reckless abandon.",
            "The holy fool: finding enlightenment in the absurd and the unexpected."
        ]
    }
```

The program needs to frame reversed cards as invitations to question assumptions and entertain alternative viewpoints. Querent interactions should support playful, lateral, or oblique engagement with the cards' meanings. The querent could be invited to question their assumptions about the situation or the card's upright meaning ("What else might be going on here?"); look for humour/irony, opportunity, or unexpected lessons in challenging circumstances; or consider how a trickster might approach or _reframe_ the issue at hand.

e.g. A subversive reversal of Death might be interpreted as "Unexpected rebirth" or "Playful ending." The querent would be encouraged to look for the humor or creative potential in experiences of loss and transformation.

As Greer cautions (and Jodorowsky echoes), a purely mechanical negation risks generating interpretations that are overly machinic or pessimistic.
