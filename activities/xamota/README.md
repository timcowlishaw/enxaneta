# Xamota

> An experimental research collaboration between an anthropologist and an interaction designer, "Xamota" explores the interplay of structured data and intuitive knowing through two locally-deployed software tools: [Humus]](https://github.com/timcowlishaw/humus) (a Rust "composting" database) and [Querent.py](https://github.com/jcalpickard/querent.py) (a Python-based tarot tool). Using reflexive software development as a form of ethnographic inquiry, this project explores how recent advancements in generative AI and machine learning are shaping our understanding of knowledge, databases, and information retrieval.
