# Xamota: "Ethnography through software development" with Humus and Querent.py

A collaboration between an anthropologist and an interaction designer, this research explores the interplay of structured data and intuitive "knowing" through the development of two interconnected software tools: Querent.py and Humus. Using an approach of "ethnography through software development," we explore how recent advancements in generative AI and machine learning are influencing our understanding of knowledge, databases, and information retrieval.


## Key components

- **Humus:** A "composting database" programmed in Rust, exploring the concept of dynamic, decaying data storage. It uses flexible, "counterfactual" database structures to challenge conventional notions of data persistence, mimicking natural processes of memory decay and information loss.
- **Querent.py:** A Python-based tool for personal tarot practice, designed for local deployment. The system incorporates both pre-populated traditional card meanings and user-generated interpretations, allowing for the evolution of meanings over time. It requires a physical tarot deck, using card draws as triggers for retrieving information from Humus. This inverts standard RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) approaches, emphasising the embodied nature of tarot practice.

Humus and Querent.py are both designed for local, single-user deployment, supporting situated knowledges and personal practice.


## Methods

### Ethnography through software development

Our primary method is what we call "ethnography through software development." Inspired by Ian Bogost's concept of "philosophical carpentry", this involves:

- Developing two interconnected software tools: Querent.py (a Python-based tarot practice tool) and Humus (a Rust-based "composting database")
- Using the process of writing code as a form of theoretical and conceptual exploration
- Reflexively engaging with the qualities of our respective codebases, IDEs, version control systems, and data structures
- Exploring how the choice of development tools and practices shapes our outputs and their capacity to support "knowing otherwise"

This method allows us to pursue insights that purely theoretical or ethnographic approaches might miss, bridging the gap between technical practice and conceptual exploration.

### Autoethnography and reflexivity

Our research heavily relies on autoethnography, positioning ourselves as both researchers and subjects. This involves:

- Regular critical reflection on the software development process and our decision-making
- Documenting our personal experiences with tarot practice and database use, and how they inform our software design
- Exploring the bodily and tactile elements of our research through techniques such as autoethnographic writing
- Examining how our roles as software developers interacts with degrowth imaginaries
- Reflecting on the challenges and opportunities of conducting this research across two locations (York and Tarragona)

This autoethnographic approach allows for a deep, reflexive exploration of the software development process and its implications for intuitive knowledge practices.

### Ecological thinking and alternative temporalities

Our project incorporates ecological thinking and alternative temporalities as both subjects of study and methodological principles. This involves:

- Implementing and experimenting with data decay mechanisms in Humus, documenting how this affects our interaction with and understanding of stored information
- Exploring alternative temporalities in our software design, contrasting with conventional notions of seamless, on-demand retrieval
- Applying ecological thinking to our development process, considering the "ecosystem" of our software, its users, and broader technological contexts
- Experimenting with different rhythms and paces in our software interactions, documenting how this affects our intuitive knowledge practices

By integrating these concepts into our methodology, we aim to challenge traditional notions of data persistence and retrieval, offering insights into more sustainable, context-aware approaches to software development.


## Research sites and contexts

Our research unfolds across multiple interconnected sites, both physical and digital. While based in York and Tarragona, our primary focus is on the digital spaces created by our software tools, Querent.py and Humus. These tools are designed for local deployment, situating our research within the intimate contexts of personal computers and domestic environments. This approach allows us to explore the intersection of digital practices and domestic spaces, taking the home computer as both research tool and field site.


## Key themes

1. **Structured knowledge and intuition:** Exploring the interplay of structured data schemas and intuitive knowledge through the lens of tarot practice; examining how this interaction informs database design and challenges conventional approaches to knowledge representation and retrieval.

2. **Query formulation and interpretation:** Investigating how people formulate questions and interpret results in both structured (database queries) and intuitive (tarot readings) contexts; exploring this comparison can inform alternative approaches to information retrieval and AI, particularly as constrasted with RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) systems.

3. **Temporality and decay in digital systems:** Investigating alternative temporalities in digital systems through the development of a 'composting database' (Humus) and tarot-inspired software (Querent.py); exploring how concepts of decay and ecological thinking can rework our understanding of data relevance, persistence, and retrieval.

4. **"Smallness" and situated software:** Developing "small", situated software as a form of critical practice; exploring how local, context-specific tools can embody "degrowth imaginaries"; challenging dominant narratives of scalability and growth in technology development.

5. **Bodies and spaces in digital practice:** Examining the translation of embodied tarot practices into digital contexts; exploring the concept of digital spaces as "nomadic cathedrals" for reflection and interpretation; investigating ways to faithfully model corporeal experiences in software design.


## Wider implications

This research aims to unsettle conventional models of generative systems and information retrieval, articulate the value of "knowing otherwise," and expand our understanding of database design through the lens of tarot practice. By focusing on "small," situated software for local deployment, we explore how such tools can engender affordances that support more intuitive ways of knowing.

Our work is situated within broader conversations about degrowth imaginaries and critiques of technological determinism. While we focus specifically on tarot practice and data decay, we hope our explorations will contribute to discussions on embodied cognition, situated learning, unconventional data structures, and the integration of intuitive knowledge in technological contexts.
